* Description
It uses =completing-read= to choose from a list of candidates.
It's rather simple, most of the time only name and disambiguation are shown.

If you have [[https://curl.se/][curl]] installed, it will be used.
Otherwise, it will use built-in url library.
Beware that some symbols are not rendered correctly when using url library.
