* Description
This package allows doing MusicBrainz searches by using their [[https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API][API]].

It uses =completing-read= to choose from a list of candidates.
It's rather simple, most of the time only name and disambiguation are shown.

It will use [[https://curl.se/][curl]] by default for doing API requests, because using built-in url library resulted in characters not rendering correctly.
If you still want to use url library for API requests, you can change the value of =mb-search-curl-p= to nil.
